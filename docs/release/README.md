## 3. Core Principles

1. **Zero Secret Persistence:** Private keys, keystores, and passwords must never be committed to Git. Local builds utilize untracked properties (`android/key.properties`) with automatic fallback to debug signing for open-source contributors and local tests.
2. **Deterministic & Reproducible Builds:** Release artifacts are produced using standardized Flutter and Gradle toolchains with verified dependencies.
3. **No Unnecessary Permissions:** The release manifest declares strictly zero unnecessary permissions (`INTERNET` and `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` are absent in production builds).
4. **Platform Compliance:** Full compliance with Android Scoped Storage, Storage Access Framework (SAF), and Android 12+ VectorDrawable splash specifications.
